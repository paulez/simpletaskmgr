# RTK (Rust Token Killer) - Token-Optimized Commands

## Golden Rule

**Always prefix commands with `rtk`**. If RTK has a dedicated filter, it uses it. If not, it passes through unchanged. This means RTK is always safe to use.

**Important**: Even in command chains with `&&`, use `rtk`:
```bash
# ❌ Wrong
git add . && git commit -m "msg" && git push

# ✅ Correct
rtk git add . && rtk git commit -m "msg" && rtk git push
```

## RTK Commands by Workflow

### Build & Compile (80-90% savings)
```bash
rtk cargo build         # Cargo build output
rtk cargo check         # Cargo check output
rtk cargo clippy        # Clippy warnings grouped by file (80%)
rtk tsc                 # TypeScript errors grouped by file/code (83%)
rtk lint                # ESLint/Biome violations grouped (84%)
rtk prettier --check    # Files needing format only (70%)
rtk next build          # Next.js build with route metrics (87%)
```

### Test (90-99% savings)
```bash
rtk cargo test          # Cargo test failures only (90%)
rtk vitest run          # Vitest failures only (99.5%)
rtk playwright test     # Playwright failures only (94%)
rtk test <cmd>          # Generic test wrapper - failures only
```

### Git (59-80% savings)
```bash
rtk git status          # Compact status
rtk git log             # Compact log (works with all git flags)
rtk git diff            # Compact diff (80%)
rtk git show            # Compact show (80%)
rtk git add             # Ultra-compact confirmations (59%)
rtk git commit          # Ultra-compact confirmations (59%)
rtk git push            # Ultra-compact confirmations
rtk git pull            # Ultra-compact confirmations
rtk git branch          # Compact branch list
rtk git fetch           # Compact fetch
rtk git stash           # Compact stash
rtk git worktree        # Compact worktree
```

Note: Git passthrough works for ALL subcommands, even those not explicitly listed.

rtk grep <pattern>      # Search grouped by file (75%)
rtk find <pattern>      # Find grouped by directory (70%)
```

### Analysis & Debug (70-90% savings)
```bash
rtk err <cmd>           # Filter errors only from any command
rtk log <file>          # Deduplicated logs with counts
rtk json <file>         # JSON structure without values
rtk deps                # Dependency overview
rtk env                 # Environment variables compact
rtk summary <cmd>       # Smart summary of command output
rtk diff                # Ultra-compact diffs
```

### Infrastructure (85% savings)
```bash
rtk docker ps           # Compact container list
rtk docker images       # Compact image list
rtk docker logs <c>     # Deduplicated logs
rtk kubectl get         # Compact resource list
rtk kubectl logs        # Deduplicated pod logs
```

### Network (65-70% savings)
```bash
rtk curl <url>          # Compact HTTP responses (70%)
rtk wget <url>          # Compact download output (65%)
```

### Meta Commands
```bash
rtk gain                # View token savings statistics
rtk gain --history      # View command history with savings
rtk discover            # Analyze Claude Code sessions for missed RTK usage
rtk proxy <cmd>         # Run command without filtering (for debugging)
rtk init                # Add RTK instructions to CLAUDE.md
rtk init --global       # Add RTK to ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md
```
